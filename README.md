# Alif Afiq - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
With a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems and Accounting, I am building my career at the intersection of data analytics and accounting awareness. I bring a detail-oriented approach to analysing data and a growing proficiency in tools like SQL, Python, Power BI, Tableau, and Excel.
My academic foundation has equipped me with technical and business insights, while hands-on projects have sharpened my ability to extract, visualise, and communicate data-driven stories. I have built dashboards, written analytical SQL queries, and tackled real-world data challenges, all with a focus on turning numbers into meaningful actions. Skilled in relational database design using Entity Relationship Diagram (ERDs) and data analysis from defined requirements. Familiar with interpreting and creating dataflow diagrams and system flowcharts for business and accounting processes.
Outside of work, I actively pursue personal data projects and continuously learn new tools and techniques to enhance my analytical toolkit. I am especially motivated by opportunities to solve practical problems using data and to support smarter, evidence-based decision-making in any organisation I contribute to.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Forte Grocery Inventory Analysis Dashboard 

**Link:**

   - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AlifAfiq/Forte-Grocery/tree/main)

   - [GitHub Pages](https://alifafiq.github.io/Forte-Grocery/)

**Description:** This project delivers insights and solutions through Power BI dashboard for Forte Grocery, analyzing sales, profit, stock levels, and supplier performance. It helps identify top-performing categories, low-stock items, and efficient suppliers. It includes transforming raw CSV data, validating with SQL, cleaning the data, and using Power BI with Power Query and DAX for visualisation.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, Data Query Language (DQL), Power Query, DAX, data visualization.

**Tools:** SQL and Power BI 

**Outcome:** The dashboard reveals that Beverages rank second in profit (20%) despite having the lowest sales volume, likely due to their high average unit price (3x Fruits & Vegetables). The dashboard highlights a major risk: current stock for items marked for reorder is only at 50% of the desired level. Supplier analysis shows that several vendors such as Rhynoodle, Mydo, and Skivee consistently deliver over 80 units in under 60 days, with Rhynoodle being the most efficient at 33 days.


### House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

**Link:** 
   - [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13RQrZP5OtqM968NdVg2p1m4dRq5AbDh3?usp=sharing)

**Goal:** To build and evaluate machine learning models that can accurately predict house prices based on various numerical features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and neighbourhood quality.

**Description:** 
This project applies supervised learning to a structured housing dataset to forecast house prices. The steps include:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Model training using Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor

- Evaluation using metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R²

- Result interpretation and proposing improvements

**Outcomes:**
- Linear Regression performed best:

	- MAE: 8174.58

	- RMSE: 10071.48

	- R²: 0.9984

- Random Forest Regressor had slightly worse performance across all metrics.

- The model can assist real estate agencies, developers, and investors in making smarter pricing decisions.

### Hero Insurance Inc. Auto Insurance ERD Design

**Link:**
  
   - [Github Repository](https://github.com/AlifAfiq/Hero-Insurance)
     
   - [Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U-bX8mvHK83jyrYNwYZKs2MBvFYGmbA7/view?usp=sharing)
   
   - [Hero Insurance Inc. Data Description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x4-N3zaBd4s3ilHYEuRyYyArRYi4IcDXOPbBkEa2Xdc/edit?usp=sharing)

**Description:** This project involves designing a fully normalised Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for Hero Insurance Inc., an auto insurance company. The system models complex business processes, including policy issuance, claim handling, accident recording, and repair workflows. The ERD was built using Crow’s foot notation and incorporates subtyping for policyholders (individuals and organisations), bridge tables for many-to-many relationships, and normalisation techniques to ensure data integrity.

**Skills:** data modelling, database normalisation (1NF, 2NF, 3NF), ERD design, relational schema design, analytical thinking, systems analysis.

**Tools:** Draw.io

**Outcomes:** Developed a normalised database design comprising over 20 interrelated tables representing real-world insurance operations. Clearly separated entities for drivers, policies, vehicles, claims, and repairs. Used bridge tables for drivers and policies, and modelled subtypes using surrogate and natural keys. The project demonstrates a strong understanding of relational database systems and has been published to GitHub as part of a professional data/system analyst portfolio.


### Pizzozo Annual Sales Report Dashboard

**Link:** 

   - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AlifAfiq/Pizzozo-Annual-Sales-Report-Dashboard)

   - [GitHub Pages](https://alifafiq.github.io/Pizzozo-Annual-Sales-Report-Dashboard/)

**Description:** This project involves creating an interactive annual sales report dashboard for a Pizzozo, focusing on revenue, orders, and sales by pizza category and size. It includes transforming raw CSV data, validating with SQL, cleaning the data, and using Power BI with Power Query and DAX for visualization.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, Data Query Language (DQL), Power Query, DAX, data visualization.

**Tools:** SQL and Power BI

**Outcomes:** Orders are highest on Friday, followed by Thursday and Saturday. The peak orders are in July, followed by May and January. Classic categories contribute just slightly more sales than other categories. Large pizza contributes significantly the most sales than other sizes. The Thai Chicken Pizza and the Barbeque Pizza contribute the most revenue. The Classic Deluxe Pizza contribute slightly more total orders than other pizzas.



### All Day Bike Dashboard

**Link:** 

   - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AlifAfiq/Development-of-All-Day-Bike-Dashboard)

   - [GitHub Pages](https://alifafiq.github.io/Development-of-All-Day-Bike-Dashboard/)
 
**Objectives:** To develop a dashboard for All Day Bike which showcases key performance metrics to support data-driven decision making. To overview the revenue generated hourly. To observe the profit and revenue trends. To gain valuable insights based on seasonal factor and rider demographics. To serve an insight on potential price adjustments for next year based on the data analysis.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, Data Query Language (DQL), Power Query, DAX, data visualization.

**Tools:** SQL and Power BI
