# Alif Afiq - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
With a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems and Accounting, I am building my career at the intersection of data analytics and accounting awareness. I bring a detail-oriented approach to analysing data and a growing proficiency in tools like SQL, Power BI, Tableau, and Excel.
My academic foundation has equipped me with technical and business insights, while hands-on projects have sharpened my ability to extract, visualise, and communicate data-driven stories. I have built dashboards, written analytical SQL queries, and tackled real-world data challenges, all with a focus on turning numbers into meaningful actions.
Outside of work, I actively pursue personal data projects and continuously learn new tools and techniques to enhance my analytical toolkit. I am especially motivated by opportunities to solve practical problems using data and to support smarter, evidence-based decision-making in any organisation I contribute to.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Forte Grocery Inventory Analysis Dashboard 

**Link:**
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AlifAfiq/Forte-Grocery/tree/main)
- [GitHub Pages](https://alifafiq.github.io/Forte-Grocery/)

**Description:** This project delivers insights and solutions through Power BI dashboard for Forte Grocery, analyzing sales, profit, stock levels, and supplier performance. It helps identify top-performing categories, low-stock items, and efficient suppliers. It includes transforming raw CSV data, validating with SQL, cleaning the data, and using Power BI with Power Query and DAX for visualisation.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, Data Query Language (DQL), Power Query, DAX, data visualization.

**Technology:** SQL and Power BI 

**Outcome:** The dashboard reveals that Beverages rank second in profit (20%) despite having the lowest sales volume, likely due to their high average unit price (3x Fruits & Vegetables). The dashboard highlights a major risk: current stock for items marked for reorder is only at 50% of the desired level. Supplier analysis shows that several vendors such as Rhynoodle, Mydo, and Skivee consistently deliver over 80 units in under 60 days, with Rhynoodle being the most efficient at 33 days.

### Pizzozo Annual Sales Report Dashboard

**Link:** 
	- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AlifAfiq/Pizzozo-Annual-Sales-Report-Dashboard)

**Description:** This project involves creating an interactive annual sales report dashboard for a Pizzozo, focusing on revenue, orders, and sales by pizza category and size. It includes transforming raw CSV data, validating with SQL, cleaning the data, and using Power BI with Power Query and DAX for visualization.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, Data Query Language (DQL), Power Query, DAX, data visualization.

**Technology:** SQL and Power BI

**Outcomes:** Orders are highest on Friday, followed by Thursday and Saturday. The peak orders are in July, followed by May and January. Classic categories contribute just slightly more sales than other categories. Large pizza contributes significantly the most sales than other sizes.

**Objectives:** To develop a dashboard for All Day Bike which showcases key performance metrics to support data-driven decision making. To overview the revenue generated hourly. To observe the profit and revenue trends. To gain valuable insights based on seasonal factor and rider demographics. To serve an insight on potential price adjustments for next year based on the data analysis.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, Data Query Language (DQL), Power Query, DAX, data visualization.
